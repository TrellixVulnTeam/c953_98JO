The project for Data Structures and Algorithms II required the development of a mail delivery application. The application uses a greedy nearest neighbor algorithm in order to compute a delivery route to have both trucks travel less than 140 miles to deliver all packages. An implementation of an hash table and a dictionary were required. This application was created using PyCharm.
